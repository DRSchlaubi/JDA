/**
 * An implementation of a Least-Recently-Used cache.
 * <br>When the cache capacity exceeds the configured maximum, the eldest cache entry is evicted.
 *
 * <p>You can use {@link #unloadUnless(MemberCachePolicy)}, to configure a conditional unloading.
 * If the configured sub-policy evaluates to {@code true}, the member will not be unloaded even when it is an old cache entry.
 *
 * <p>This is implemented using a queue and counter algorithm, to achieve amortized O(1) performance.
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b><br>
 * <pre>{@code
 * MemberCachePolicy.ONLINE.and( // only cache online members
 *   MemberCachePolicy.lru(1000) // of those online members, track the 1000 most active members
 *     .unloadUnless(MemberCachePolicy.VOICE) // always keep voice members cached regardless of age
 * )
 * }</pre>
 *
 * This policy would add online members into the pool of cached members.
 * The cached members are limited to 1000 active members, which are handled by the LRU policy.
 * When the LRU cache exceeds the maximum, it will evict the least recently active member from cache.
 * If the sub-policy, in this case {@link MemberCachePolicy#VOICE}, evaluates to {@code true}, the member is retained in cache.
 * Otherwise, the member is unloaded using {@link Guild#unloadMember(long)}.
 *
 * <p>Note that the LRU policy itself always returns {@code true} for {@link #cacheMember(Member)}, since that makes the member the <b>most recently used</b> instead.
 *
